# Codsoft-Web-Development
Welcome to my Web Development Internship Portfolio! In this repository, you will find a collection of projects that I have completed during my internship at Codsoft. Exploring frontend and backend technologies to build modern, responsive, and dynamic web applications.

<h1>Introduction</h1>

I am delighted to share my experiences and accomplishments during the CODSOFT Web development Internship, where I was privileged to explore three out of five diverse projects .Each project showcases my skills in building responsive web applications . This internship has been a rich learning experience, and I am eager to present the outcomes of my diligent efforts. The following are the projects assigned by CODSOFT during this internship tenure:

<h3>Task 1:PORTFOLIO</h3>
      
A personal portfolio is a website that showcases an individual's skills, experience, and accomplishments in a particular field. For web development beginners, creating a personal portfolio using CSS and HTML is a popular project that can help demonstrate their abilities to potential employers.

<h3>Task 2:LANDING PAGE</h3>
      
A landing page is a single-page website that serves as an entry point for a product, service, or company. Requiring only a foundational understanding of HTML and CSS, creating a landing page is an ideal way for beginners to hone their coding skills and showcase their capabilities to potential employers.

<h3>Task 3:CALCULATOR</h3>
      
To build a basic calculator, you'll need to design an interactive interface with buttons for various mathematical operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project requires a combination of HTML for structuring the layout, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for adding functionality to the calculator.
